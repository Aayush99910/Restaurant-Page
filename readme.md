Restaurant Page made with the help of Javascript and css. There is very less HTML code. I really couldn't do this in any other way. I am sure there are other ways to do this page but I did what I knew. It was really frustrating but I learned a lot. 

Things I learned:
-- How to use webpack.
-- How to import and export module 
-- And othe minor things.
